Walmart is the biggest retail store in the United States. Just like others, they have been expanding their e-commerce part of the business. By the end of 2022, e-commerce represented a roaring $80 billion in sales, which is 13% of total sales of Walmart. One of the main factors that affects their sales is public holidays, like the Super Bowl, Labour Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.

This project is about creating a data pipeline for the analysis of supply and demand around the holidays, along with conducting a preliminary analysis on two data sources: grocery sales and complementary data. A `PostgreSQL` database with the following features:

# `grocery_sales`

- `"index"` - unique ID of the row
- `"Store_ID"` - the store number
- `"Date"` - the week of sales
- `"Weekly_Sales"` - sales for the given store

# `extra_data.parquet`

- `"IsHoliday"` - Whether the week contains a public holiday - 1 if yes, 0 if no.
- `"Temperature"` - Temperature on the day of sale
- `"Fuel_Price"` - Cost of fuel in the region
- `"CPI"` â€“ Prevailing consumer price index
- `"Unemployment"` - The prevailing unemployment rate
- `"MarkDown1"`, `"MarkDown2"`, `"MarkDown3"`, `"MarkDown4"` - number of promotional markdowns
- `"Dept"` - Department Number in each store
- `"Size"` - size of the store
- `"Type"` - type of the store (depends on `Size` column)

Those files are merged and transformed. The transformed DataFrame is stored as the `clean_data` variable containing the following columns:

- `"Store_ID"`
- `"Month"`
- `"Dept"`
- `"IsHoliday"`
- `"Weekly_Sales"`
- `"CPI"`
- "`"Unemployment"`"

After merging and cleaning the data, I analyzed monthly sales of Walmart and stored the results of my analysis as the `agg_data` variable that should look like:

| Month | Weekly_Sales |
| ----- | ------------ |
| 1.0   | 33174.178494 |
| 2.0   | 34333.326579 |
| ...   | ...          |
